## Overview

AI agents are revolutionizing how businesses enhance their operational capabilities and enterprise applications. By enabling natural language interactions, these agents provide customers with a streamlined, personalized experience. [Amazon Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/) uses the capabilities of foundation models (FMs), combining them with APIs and data to process user requests, gather information, and execute specific tasks effectively. The introduction of now enables organizations to orchestrate multiple specialized AI agents working together to tackle complex, multi-step challenges that require diverse expertise. 

[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) offers a diverse selection of FMs, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your specific use case. Among these offerings, [Amazon Nova](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/) stands out as AWS's next-generation FM, delivering breakthrough intelligence and industry-leading performance at exceptional value.

The Amazon Nova family comprises two types of models:

* Understanding models ‚Äì Available in Micro, Lite, and Pro variants
* Content generation models ‚Äì Featuring Canvas and Reel

These models are specifically optimized for enterprise and business applications, excelling in the following capabilities:

* Text generation
* Summarization
* Complex reasoning tasks
* Content creation

This makes Amazon Nova ideal for sophisticated use cases like our FinOps solution.

A key advantage of the Amazon Nova model family is its [industry-leading price-performance ratio](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-nova-frontier-intelligence-and-industry-leading-price-performance/). Compared to other enterprise-grade AI models, Amazon Nova offers comparable or superior capabilities at a more competitive price point. This cost-effectiveness, combined with its versatility and performance, makes Amazon Nova an attractive choice for businesses looking to implement advanced AI solutions.

In this guidance, we use the [multi-agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-multi-agent-collaboration.html) feature of Amazon Bedrock to demonstrate a powerful and innovative approach to [AWS cost management](). By using the advanced capabilities of Amazon Nova FMs, we've developed a solution that showcases how AI-driven agents can revolutionize the way organizations analyze, optimize, and manage their AWS costs.

## Guidance overview

Our innovative AWS cost management guidance uses the power of AI and multi-agent collaboration to provide comprehensive cost analysis and optimization recommendations. The core of the system is built around three key components:

* FinOps supervisor agent ‚Äì Acts as the central coordinator, managing user queries and orchestrating the activities of specialized subordinate agents
* Cost analysis agent ‚Äì Uses [AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) to gather and analyze cost data for specified time ranges
* Cost optimization agent ‚Äì Uses the [AWS Trusted Advisor Cost Optimization Pillar](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/) to provide actionable cost-saving recommendations

The guidance integrates the multi-agent collaboration capabilities of Amazon Bedrock with Amazon Nova to create an intelligent, interactive, cost management AI assistant. This integration enables seamless communication between specialized agents, each focusing on different aspects of AWS cost management. Key features of the guidance include:

* User authentication through [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) with [role-based access control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/role-based-access-control.html)
* Frontend application hosted on [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
* Real-time cost insights and historical analysis
* Actionable cost optimization recommendations
* Parallel processing of tasks for improved efficiency

By combining AI-driven analysis with AWS cost management tools, this guidance offers finance teams and cloud administrators a powerful, user-friendly interface to gain deep insights into AWS spending patterns and identify cost-saving opportunities.

The architecture displayed in the following diagram uses several AWS services, including [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions, to create a scalable, secure, and efficient system. This approach demonstrates the potential of AI-driven multi-agent systems to assist with cloud financial management and solve a wide range of cloud management challenges.

*Figure 1. Reference Architecture of Cost Analysis and Optimization with Amazon Bedrock Agents*

<u>Architecture Workflow</u>:

1. The Administrator User deploys the guidance to AWS Account and Region using an AWS CloudFormation Template.
The Base AWS CloudFormation stack will deploy and create all of the AWS resources needed to host the guidance. This includes Amazon Cognito User group and user, Amazon Bedrock Agents, AWS Lambda Functions, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and AWS STS token.
2. The user navigates to the Secure Chat UI URL
3. Secure Chat  application is hosted on AWS Amplify
4. The web page is returned with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  User is now able to input the configuration details for Amazon Cognito and Amazon Bedrock Agents
5. Upon configuration completion, the user is prompted to authenticate using Amazon Cognito with a username and password configured for them in the user pool
6. After successful authentication, Cognito Identity Pool will negotiate temporary credentials from AWS Simple Token Service (STS)
7. Cognito Identity Pool passes temporary AWS credentials to the Secure Chat UI
8. Once authenticated, the user now sees the Secure Chat UI chat prompt to interact with the Amazon Bedrock Agent that is configured
9. The FinOps Supervisor Agent evaluates each User's question and directs it to one of two specialized sub-agents: the Cost Analysis Agent or the Cost Optimization Agent
10. Each specialized agent (Cost Analysis or Cost Optimization) reviews its predefined set of actions to identify the correct procedure for answering the user's question
11. The action groups execute their respective AWS  Lambda functions to fetch data, whether that's accessing the AWS Cost Explorer API or pulling recommendations from Trusted Advisor's Cost Optimization pillar
12. The FinOps Supervisor Agent compiles all the gathered data into a final answer and sends it back to the Secure Chat UI visible to the User

In the following sections, we dive deeper into the architecture of our guidance, explore the capabilities of each agent, and discuss the potential impact of this approach on AWS cost management strategies.

## Security

When you build systems on AWS infrastructure, security responsibilities are shared between you and AWS. This [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) reduces your operational burden because AWS operates, manages, and controls the components including the host operating system, the virtualization layer, and the physical security of the facilities in which the services operate. For more information about AWS security, visit [AWS Cloud Security](http://aws.amazon.com/security/).

This Guidance implements the following security features:

- **Amazon Cognito user authentication** - Secure user authentication with user pools and identity pools
- **Role-based access control** - Ensures that only authorized users can access specific functionality
- **IAM roles and policies** - Provides least-privilege permissions for Lambda functions and other AWS services
- **Secure API communication** - All communication between components uses HTTPS encryption
